## Changelog

Recent Changes:
- July 19, 2025: ✅ COMPLETED migration from Replit Agent to Replit environment and resolved Netlify database connection issue. Successfully connected application to user's original Neon database containing 8 franchises (MILKSTER, TechFlow Solutions, Fitness Plus, etc.) and 6 businesses. Fixed WebSocket constructor configuration in both Replit server and all Netlify functions. Hardcoded database URL directly in code eliminating need for environment variables in Netlify deployment. Fixed database schema compatibility by updating to match actual Neon database structure (username-based auth, removed user relationships). Added utf-8-validate and bufferutil dependencies to resolve Netlify build errors. Application now displays authentic franchise and business data from user's Neon database. Netlify deployment ready with zero configuration required.
- July 18, 2025: ✅ COMPLETED comprehensive admin role-based access control system. Implemented user-specific access control where customers can only view their own business listings and advertisements with status visibility (active/inactive, pending/approved), while admin has full control over all franchises, businesses, and advertisements with activation/deactivation capabilities.
